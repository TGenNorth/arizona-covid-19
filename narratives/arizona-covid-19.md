abstract: "Maintained by the AZ COVID Genomics Union (ACGU).

The Arizona COVID-19 Genomics Union (ACGU) uses state-of-the-art sequencers and custom computational analysis workflows to sequence patients’ SARS-CoV-2 RNA genomes and to track the mutations in the virus to map its spread. By comparing mutations observed in Arizona to those present in strains circulating across the globe, we are determining when and from where the virus is coming into Arizona. By comparing strains within Arizona, the ACGU is also mapping the virus' transmission within and among Arizona’s communities.

From among the 240,000+ positive cases in Arizona, the ACGU has sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from over 5,000 COVID-19 positive samples, making this sequencing effort one of the most extensive in the nation.

The ACGU is a collaboration of scientists from the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Northern Arizona University (NAU), University of Arizona (UArizona), and Arizona State University (ASU)."

# [Arizona’s COVID-19 Timeline](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/gst)

COVID-19 has hugely impacted Arizona over the past nine months, sweeping through urban and rural areas, tribal nations, and correctional and healthcare facilities.

Arizona detected its first COVID-19 case on January 26, but it was not until late March that state public health officials reported widespread community transmission. Throughout June and July, hospitalizations were at an all-time high, infection rates among individuals aged 20–44 skyrocketed, and Arizona’s case rate per 100,000 was almost double what was reported for the United States. As of October 27, 2020, Arizona has reported over 240,000 cases and 5,800 deaths.

The Arizona Department of Health Services maintains a [COVID-19 Data Dashboard](https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php), updated daily.

# [Arizona SARS-CoV-2 Genomes in a Global Context](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/?c=location&p=full)

COVID-19 came into Arizona from many different places, as demonstrated by this phylogenetic tree that displays the relatedness of different strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The strains that are now circulating in Arizona are representative of strains from around the world; however, the vast majority of Arizona’s cases are from strain types shared with other U.S. states or European countries.

This build includes a dataset of 3010 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from COVID-19 positive patient specimens from across Arizona. Positive specimens came from the TGen North Clinical Laboratory, Arizona State Public Health Laboratory, and Sonora Quest Laboratory between March and August. The Arizona genomes are shown here with a set of 532 genomes from around the world shared in the [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/) database.

# [Arizona’s First COVID-19 Cases were Successfully Contained](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/?c=location&p=full&s=USA-AZ1-2020)

COVID-19 hit Arizona on January 22, 2020, when a 26-year-old male presented to a clinic in Maricopa County, reporting a two-day history of nonproductive cough. He denied fever and other symptoms at presentation. He had returned from travel to China (including Wuhan City) three days prior to presentation, and reported having contact with one person with cough and fever while in China. This case was rapidly quarantined. Despite this man testing positive up to eighteen days after diagnosis, no SARS-CoV-2 transmission was detected among ten high-risk contacts, including one intimate contact, based on serial testing.

The CDC [published a genome sequence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN997409.1) for the sample collected from this initial case. Genomic analysis by the ACGU shows this virus strain is closely related to others from Asia (as shown), and supports the public health contact tracing conclusions that no transmission of this initial case happened, as no strains of virus collected later in Arizona descend from this lineage.

**_Rapid public health response efforts, including quarantining, testing, and contact tracing, prevented this case from potentially igniting a much earlier outbreak in Arizona._**

# [An Early Pandemic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Population Structure and Dynamics in Arizona](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/)

Findings reported by the ACGU show that the state experienced no COVID-19 cases resulting from transmission from the first reported case in late January. However, at least 11 distinct incursions occurred, with introductions between mid-February and late March. The [published results](https://tgen.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6b0e128788a10661a1fb2d549&id=f3e6925358&e=81c3146932) appear in the scientific journal mBio. This [study](https://tgen.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6b0e128788a10661a1fb2d549&id=f3e6925358&e=81c3146932) was supported by: The NARBHA Institute, Flinn Foundation, The Virginia G.

# [SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Arizona](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/gst)

## SARS-CoV-2 was introduced at least twelve times

Genomic analyses show early Arizona strains belong to 11 distinct lineages (i.e. strain types) and/or sublineages. None of these lineages were unique to Arizona; they have all been documented in other parts of the U.S. and, in most cases, in other countries.

The geographic ubiquity of the major SARS-CoV-2 lineages clearly demonstrates how frequently this virus has moved around the world. Given these observations and the timing and size of the Arizona outbreak in March, the number of distinct lineages (12, including the first case in January) is a conservative estimate for the number of independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Arizona: the state likely experienced more than 12 introductions, as several belong to the same viral lineage and are thus indistinguishable from other potential introductions.

## First introductions resulting in community transmission were in mid- to late February

The introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Arizona that resulted in community transmission were in February and March, according to ACGU’s molecular clock analysis, which calculates the dates of transmission events based on the number of mutations present. (A molecular clock assumes that mutations happen at a constant rate, so the number of mutational differences between two genomes tells how much time has passed since they originated from the same person.)

## Introductions mostly resulted from domestic travel

More than 80% of Arizona’s first SARS-CoV-2 genomes descended from strains that were initially circulating widely in Europe but have since dominated the outbreak in the U.S. In addition, the first reported case of community transmission in Arizona descended from the Washington state outbreak that was discovered in late February.

**First introductions were as early as mid-February.** Molecular clock analyses back-calculate the date that each lineage of virus spreading in Arizona (color-coded above) originated from one individual, i.e., the person that carried the virus into the state. The five major early lineages of virus in Arizona were estimated to be carried in in mid-February to late March.

**First introductions were mostly from domestic travel.** For six of the earliest strain types of SARS-CoV-2 in Arizona (A.1 to B.1.29), those same strain types were found in other parts of North America (blue) and Europe (gray). This shows that the introductions of COVID-19 to Arizona likely came with people traveling within the U.S. or from Europe.

# [COVID-19 Level in Arizona is “Widespread”](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/?c=location&d=map&f_division=Arizona&p=full&r=location)

On March 26, the Arizona Department of Health Services updated the community transmission level of COVID-19 in Arizona to “Widespread”, indicating that more than twelve of the fifteen counties reported COVID-19 cases. This map shows that by March 26, 64 genomes had been sequenced from COVID-19 cases from eleven of those twelve counties.
 
**Due to availability of samples for sequencing, the number of genomes is not representative of the case counts in each county.**
