abstract: "Maintained by the Arizona COVID Genomics Union (ACGU) 
 
The Arizona COVID-19 Genomics Union (ACGU) uses multiple sequencing platforms and custom computational analysis workflows to sequence SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes from COVID-19 patient specimens and to track the spread of viral variants. By comparing mutations observed in Arizona to those present in strains circulating across the globe, we are determining when and from where the virus is coming into Arizona. By comparing strains within Arizona, the ACGU is also mapping the virus' transmission within and among Arizona’s communities.
 
From among the >1,175,000 positive COVID-19 cases in Arizona, the ACGU has sequenced and analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes from over 32,000, making this sequencing effort one of the most extensive in the nation.
 
The ACGU is a collaboration of scientists from the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Northern Arizona University (NAU), University of Arizona (UArizona), and Arizona State University (ASU)."

# [Arizona’s COVID-19 Timeline](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/)

COVID-19 has hugely impacted Arizona over the past nine months, sweeping through urban and rural areas, tribal nations, and correctional and healthcare facilities. 
 
Arizona detected its first COVID-19 case on January 26, but it was not until late March that state public health officials reported widespread community transmission. Throughout June and July, hospitalizations were at an all-time high, infection rates among individuals aged 20–44 skyrocketed, and Arizona’s case rate per 100,000 was almost double what was reported for the United States. Despite mitigation efforts implemented statewide, Arizona began to experience a second wave beginning in mid-November that has continued into 2021. As of January 22 2021, Arizona has reported over 700,000 cases and 12,000 deaths.
 
The Arizona Department of Health Services maintains a [COVID-19 Data Dashboard](https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php), updated daily.

# [Arizona SARS-CoV-2 Genomes in a Global Context](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/?c=location&d=tree&p=full)

COVID-19 came into Arizona from several different places, as demonstrated by this phylogenetic tree (colors representing Arizona counties) that displays the relatedness of different strains of the SARS-CoV-2. The strains that are now circulating in Arizona are closely related to strains from many other countries; however, the vast majority of Arizona’s strain types are shared with other U.S. states or Europe, and typified by the presence of the now famous spike protein D614G mutation.
 
This build includes a dataset of 3010 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from COVID-19 positive patient specimens from across Arizona. Positive specimens came from the TGen North Clinical Laboratory, Arizona State Public Health Laboratory, Sonora Quest Laboratory, Arizona State University, and University of Arizona, and were collected between March 2020 and October 2021. The Arizona genomes are shown here with a set of 532 genomes from around the world shared in the [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/) database.

# [Arizona’s First COVID-19 Cases were Successfully Contained](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/AZ1?c=az1&d=tree&p=full)

COVID-19 hit Arizona on January 22, 2020, when a 26-year-old male presented to a clinic in Maricopa County, reporting a two-day history of nonproductive cough. At presentation, he denied fever and other symptoms. He had returned from travel to China (including Wuhan City) three days prior to presentation, and reported having contact with one person with cough and fever while in China. This case was rapidly quarantined. Despite this individual testing positive up to eighteen days after diagnosis, no SARS-CoV-2 transmission was detected among ten high-risk contacts (including one intimate contact).
 
The CDC [published a genome sequence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN997409.1) for the sample collected from this initial case. Genomic analysis by the ACGU shows this virus strain is closely related to others from Asia (as shown), and supports the public health contact tracing conclusions that no transmission of this initial case happened, as no strains of virus collected later in Arizona descend from this lineage.
 
In summary, rapid public health response efforts, including quarantining, testing, and contact tracing, likely prevented this case from initiating a late January outbreak in Arizona.

# [An Early Pandemic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Population Structure and Dynamics in Arizona](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/mbio?d=tree&p=full)

As described on the previous page of this narrative, early findings of the ACGU showed that Arizona did not have any COVID-19 cases resulting from transmission from the first reported case in late January. However, at least 11 distinct viral importations occurred shortly thereafter, [with introductions between mid-February and late March](https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19?n=5). The [published results](https://tgen.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6b0e128788a10661a1fb2d549&id=f3e6925358&e=81c3146932) appear in the scientific journal mBio.

# [SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Arizona](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/)

## SARS-CoV-2 was introduced at least twelve times

Genomic analyses show early Arizona strains belong to 11 distinct lineages (i.e. strain types) and/or sublineages. None of these lineages were unique to Arizona; they have all been documented in other parts of the U.S. and, in most cases, in other countries. 
 
The geographic ubiquity of the major SARS-CoV-2 lineages clearly demonstrates how frequently this virus has moved around the world. Given these observations and the timing and size of the Arizona outbreak in March, the number of distinct lineages (12, including the first case in January) is a conservative estimate for the number of independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Arizona: the state likely experienced more than 12 introductions, as several likely belong to the same viral lineage and are thus indistinguishable from other potential introductions.

## First introductions resulting in community transmission were in mid to late February

The introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Arizona that resulted in community transmission were in February and March, according to ACGU’s molecular clock analysis, which inferscalculates the dates of transmission events based on the number of mutations present. (A molecular clock assumes that mutations happen at a prescribed rate, so the number and type of mutational differences between two genomes tells how much time has passed since they originated from the same person).

## Introductions mostly resulted from domestic travel

The first reported case of community transmission in Arizona descended from the Washington state outbreak, which originated from China and was discovered in late February. Subsequently, more than 80% of Arizona’s SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Spring 2020 descended from strains that were initially circulating widely in Europe but have since dominated the epidemic in the U.S.

**First introductions were as early as mid-February**. Molecular clock analyses back-calculate the date that each lineage of virus spreading in Arizona (color-coded above) originated from one individual, i.e., the person that carried the virus into the state. The five major early lineages of virus in Arizona were estimated to be carried in in mid-February to late March.

<img src="https://pathogen.tgen.org/epitools/static/nextstrain/images/az-covid-6.png" width="650">

**First introductions were mostly from domestic travel**. For six of the earliest strain types of SARS-CoV-2 in Arizona (A.1 to B.1.29), those same strain types were found in other parts of North America (blue) and Europe (gray). This demonstrates that the introductions of COVID-19 to Arizona likely came with people traveling within the U.S. or from Europe.

# [Genomic Epidemiology of a COVID-19 Outbreak Among Residents and Staff Linked to a Developmentally Disabled Adult Group Home](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/Hozhoni?c=gt-S_5&d=tree&m=div&p=full)

Local public health officials responded to an outbreak of COVID-19 among staff and residents associated with a multi-residential group home that provides care for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Samples were collected at 16 facilities; for four houses located geographically within seven miles of each other, all residents tested positive. In the remaining 12 houses where samples were collected, all residents tested negative.
 
As expected, all genomes associated with this outbreak are from the lineage of SARS-CoV-2 that is dominant in North America and are very closely related to one another. Two mutations unique to the genomes in this cluster (C13860T and C21575T) confer an L5F amino acid substitution in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gene. Whether this mutation confers a phenotype change in the virus is currently unknown.
 
The epidemiologic and genomic evidence correlate and suggest that infected staff introduced COVID-19 into this setting. Staff initially interacted with residents from multiple homes until COVID-19 was discovered. Enhanced precautions and infection control measures by staff and timely intervention by public health officials likely curbed this outbreak. 
 
Rapid genomic analyses can provide a better understanding of transmission patterns and further guide future public health response efforts.

# [Potential transmission and genomic distance network of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases associated with an outbreak at an adult group home setting](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19?c=mutation&d=tree&p=full)

To further characterize and understand the dynamics of this outbreak, a potential transmission network was developed using MicrobeTrace (14), which incorporates person-place linkages of all 42 positive cases ascertained through public health investigations (Figure 2). Each node is sized according to the number of person-place connections (e.g. more cases are associated with House A than House B). The letters reference the residential homes (A-G) and the hospital (H). Panels A-C illustrate the positive individuals and their associated locations by week of the outbreak, with panel D demonstrating the complete network highlighting the interactions and connections between staff with respect to each group home location and its residents. The network also displays the hypothesized movement of the virus throughout the homes, and indicates that asymptomatic staff connected to multiple homes likely played a significant role in sourcing this outbreak.
 
Sequencing data were not available for every positive case, a well understood limitation when conducting genomic epidemiologic analyses, making it difficult to infer informative transmission maps. However, while a clear transmission pattern could not necessarily be ascertained through the genomics alone, the phylogeny of the outbreak shows a highly connected genomic network, and heightens the importance of using epidemiologic information in the context of the sequencing data when interpreting findings. Overall, genomic and epidemiologic evidence supports our hypothesis and suggests that infected staff introduced COVID-19 into this setting, played a role in spreading the virus among the multiple homes, and contributed to limited community transmission.

# [Contact Tracing Identified Likely Transmission Chain of SARS-CoV-2 from Index Case](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19)

The phylogenetic analysis of this cluster correlates well to the series of events uncovered in the epidemiological investigation, and suggests successful isolation efforts with no further spread - in and among these households. However, the larger outbreak in this tribal community stemmed from this single case, and this was uncovered only by genomic analysis.

# [Public Health Significance](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/)

Using genomic epidemiology, we have a better understanding of the circulation of strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus among Arizona communities, which is critical to guide an effective public health response to track and curb the spread of the virus, now and in the future. Whole genome sequencing of the viral genome from infected persons clinical specimens, along with information about the collection of the specimens (when and where), allow for phylogenetic reconstruction to track the circulation and transmission of the virus locally and globally. We use these data to understand viral movement, identify origins of introductions of different COVID-19 strains to the region, locate hot spots of local transmission and clusters of disease, and possibly determine the source of infection. We can also study mutations in the viral genome and their potential for causing increased transmission or virulence.

# [Methodology](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/)

Samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 (confirmed by RT-PCR) were extracted using the MagMax Viral Pathogen II kit from ThermoFisher, or the Quick-RNA Viral kit from Zymo (for clinical samples extracted under the FDA’s Emergency Use criteria). Extracted RNA was prepared for either whole meta-transcriptome sequencing or tiled amplicon sequencing. Whole meta-transcriptome sequencing was performed using either Tecan’s Ovation SoLo RNA Seq kit, or TakaraBio’s SMART-Seq Stranded kit, both according to manufacturer’s specifications. Tiled amplicon sequencing was performed using the ARTIC protocol (v1) by Josh Quick, and adapter addition was done using Seqwell’s plexWell kit, or Illumina’s DNA-prep kit, both according to manufacturer’s instructions for small amplicons. Sequencing was done on a NextSeq 550 with v2.5 chemistry and 150 bp paired-end reads, a MiSeq with V3 chemistry and 300 bp paired-end reads, or a MiSeq with V2 chemistry and 250 bp paired-end reads.
