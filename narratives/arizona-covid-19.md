abstract: "Maintained by the AZ COVID Genomics Union (ACGU).

The Arizona COVID-19 Genomics Union (ACGU) uses multiple sequencing platforms and custom computational analysis workflows to sequence SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes from COVID-19 patient specimens and to track the mutations in the virus to map its spread. By comparing mutations observed in Arizona to those present in strains circulating across the globe, we are determining when and from where the virus is coming into Arizona. By comparing strains within Arizona, the ACGU is also mapping the virus' transmission within and among Arizona’s communities.
 
From among the >250,000 positive COVID-19 cases in Arizona, the ACGU has sequenced and analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes from over 5,000, making this sequencing effort one of the most extensive in the nation. 
 
The ACGU is a collaboration of scientists from the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Northern Arizona University (NAU), University of Arizona (UArizona), and Arizona State University (ASU)."

# [Arizona’s COVID-19 Timeline](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/)

COVID-19 has hugely impacted Arizona over the past nine months, sweeping through urban and rural areas, tribal nations, and correctional and healthcare facilities. 
 
Arizona detected its first COVID-19 case on January 26, but it was not until late March that state public health officials reported widespread community transmission. Throughout June and July, hospitalizations were at an all-time high, infection rates among individuals aged 20–44 skyrocketed, and Arizona’s case rate per 100,000 was almost double what was reported for the United States. As of November 4, 2020, Arizona has reported over 250,000 cases and 6,000 deaths.
 
The Arizona Department of Health Services maintains a [COVID-19 Data Dashboard](https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php), updated daily.

# [Arizona SARS-CoV-2 Genomes in a Global Context](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/?c=location&d=tree&p=full)

COVID-19 came into Arizona from several different places, as demonstrated by this phylogenetic tree that displays the relatedness of different strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from around the world. (The colors represent the counties in Arizona.) The strains that are now circulating in Arizona are representative of strains from many other countries; however, the vast majority of Arizona’s strain types are shared with other U.S. states or Europe, as typified by the presence of the now famous spike gene D614G mutation.
 
This build includes a dataset of 3010 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from COVID-19 positive patient specimens from across Arizona. Positive specimens came from the TGen North Clinical Laboratory, Arizona State Public Health Laboratory, Sonora Quest Laboratory, Arizona State University, and University of Arizona, between March and August. The Arizona genomes are shown here with a set of 532 genomes from around the world shared in the [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/) database.

# [Arizona’s First COVID-19 Cases were Successfully Contained](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/AZ1?c=az1&d=tree&p=full)

COVID-19 hit Arizona on January 22, 2020, when a 26-year-old male presented to a clinic in Maricopa County, reporting a two-day history of nonproductive cough. He denied fever and other symptoms at presentation. He had returned from travel to China (including Wuhan City) three days prior to presentation, and reported having contact with one person with cough and fever while in China. This case was rapidly quarantined. Despite this individual testing positive up to eighteen days after diagnosis, no SARS-CoV-2 transmission was detected among ten high-risk contacts, including one intimate contact, based on serial testing. 
 
The CDC [published a genome sequence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN997409.1) for the sample collected from this initial case. Genomic analysis by the ACGU shows this virus strain is closely related to others from Asia (as shown), and supports the public health contact tracing conclusions that no transmission of this initial case happened, as no strains of virus collected later in Arizona descend from this lineage. 
 
**_Rapid public health response efforts, including quarantining, testing, and contact tracing, likely prevented this case from initiating a late January outbreak in Arizona._**

# [An Early Pandemic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Population Structure and Dynamics in Arizona](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/mbio?d=tree&p=full)

Early findings of the ACGU showed that Arizona did not have any COVID-19 cases resulting from transmission from the first reported case in late January. However, at least 11 distinct viral importations occurred shortly thereafter, [with introductions between mid-February and late March](https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19?n=5). The [published results](https://tgen.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6b0e128788a10661a1fb2d549&id=f3e6925358&e=81c3146932) appear in the scientific journal mBio.

# [SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Arizona](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/)

## SARS-CoV-2 was introduced at least twelve times

Genomic analyses show early Arizona strains belong to 11 distinct lineages (i.e. strain types) and/or sublineages. None of these lineages were unique to Arizona; they have all been documented in other parts of the U.S. and, in most cases, in other countries. 
 
The geographic ubiquity of the major SARS-CoV-2 lineages clearly demonstrates how frequently this virus has moved around the world. Given these observations and the timing and size of the Arizona outbreak in March, the number of distinct lineages (12, including the first case in January) is a conservative estimate for the number of independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Arizona: the state likely experienced more than 12 introductions, as several likely belong to the same viral lineage and are thus indistinguishable from other potential introductions.

## First introductions resulting in community transmission were in mid to late February

The introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Arizona that resulted in community transmission were in February and March, according to ACGU’s molecular clock analysis, which calculates the dates of transmission events based on the number of mutations present. (A molecular clock assumes that mutations happen at a prescribed rate, so the number and type of mutational differences between two genomes tells how much time has passed since they originated from the same person).

## Introductions mostly resulted from domestic travel

The first reported case of community transmission in Arizona descended from the Washington state outbreak, which originated from China and was discovered in late February. Subsequently, more than 80% of Arizona’s SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Spring 2020 descended from strains that were initially circulating widely in Europe but have since dominated the epidemic in the U.S.

**First introductions were as early as mid-February**. Molecular clock analyses back-calculate the date that each lineage of virus spreading in Arizona (color-coded above) originated from one individual, i.e., the person that carried the virus into the state. The five major early lineages of virus in Arizona were estimated to be carried in in mid-February to late March.

**First introductions were mostly from domestic travel**. For six of the earliest strain types of SARS-CoV-2 in Arizona (A.1 to B.1.29), those same strain types were found in other parts of North America (blue) and Europe (gray). This demonstrates that the introductions of COVID-19 to Arizona likely came with people traveling within the U.S. or from Europe.

# [COVID-19 Level in Arizona is “Widespread”](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/?c=location&d=map&f_division=Arizona&p=full&r=location)

On March 26, the Arizona Department of Health Services updated the community transmission level of COVID-19 in Arizona to “Widespread”, indicating that more than twelve of the fifteen counties reported COVID-19 cases. This map shows that by March 26, 64 genomes had been sequenced from COVID-19 cases from eleven of those twelve counties.
 
**Due to availability of samples for sequencing, the number of genomes is not representative of the case counts in each county.**

# [Genomic Epidemiology of a COVID-19 Outbreak Among Residents and Staff Linked to a Developmentally Disabled Adult Group Home](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/Hozhoni?c=gt-S_5&d=tree&m=div&p=full)

Local public health officials responded to an outbreak of COVID-19 among staff and residents associated with a multi-residential group home that provides care for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Samples were collected at 16 facilities; for four houses located geographically within seven miles of each other, all residents tested positive. In the remaining 12 houses where samples were collected, all residents tested negative.

As expected, all genomes associated with this outbreak are from the lineage of SARS-CoV-2 that is dominant in North America and are very closely related to one another. Two mutations unique to the genomes in this cluster (C13860T and C21575T) confer an L5F amino acid substitution in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gene. Whether this mutation confers a phenotype change in the virus is currently unknown.

The epidemiologic and genomic evidence correlate and suggest that infected staff introduced COVID-19 into this setting. Staff initially interacted with residents from multiple homes until COVID-19 was discovered. Enhanced precautions and infection control measures by staff and timely intervention by public health officials curbed this outbreak.

Rapid genomic analyses can provide a better understanding of transmission patterns and further guide future public health response efforts.

# [Rapid Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in an Arizona Tribal Community with Low Mortality](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/?c=mutation&d=tree&p=full)

Although the introduction of [SARS-CoV-2 into Arizona was likely in February](https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/5/e02107-20), COVID-19 didn’t hit a Native American (NA) community until over a month later. This community’s first COVID-19 case was diagnosed on April 1; shortly thereafter, the area experienced the highest rate of infection documented to date (25% of the population on the reservation). However, with 34 deaths, the community has a case fatality rate of ~1.4%, one of the lowest recorded to date—a remarkable outcome, considering the high comorbidity burden and multi-generational living conditions typical of NA communities. The low fatality rates may be driven in large part by the [successful on-ground, rapid test-and-treat interventions from local health workers](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2023540).
 
This tribe’s index case (sample collected March 29) was a 47-year old healthcare employee that had an onset of fever and cough on March 25. This individual had recently traveled to Phoenix but continued to work. Genomic analysis shows Patient A1 seeded the outbreak comprising the majority of cases on this reservation, and mostly exclusive to this reservation, illustrated by the monophyletic clade defined by an amino acid change in the spike protein H245Y. All identified cases in April and most in May from this rural Arizona community make up this clade, which illustrates the rapid spread of a single clone. 
 
A second independent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into this tribal population is also responsible for significant morbidity. The earliest cases that are epidemiologically linked to this clade are from three individuals that tested positive on May 2nd and May 4, while the first sample in the genomic analysis was collected May 5. The congregation of these individuals with others in a local dwelling likely fueled this outbreak and spread it to many members of a particular tribal neighborhood. Between early May and early June, ~150 cases from this introduction were identified, recognized by the mutation conferring the amino acid change R209I in the virus nucleocapsid gene.
 
Studies are ongoing to determine if the virus mutations seen in this host population confer any phenotypic effects on the virus.

# [Public Health Significance](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/)

sing genomic epidemiology, we have a better understanding of the circulation of strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus among Arizona communities, which is critical to guide an effective public health response to curb the spread of the virus now and in the future. Whole genome sequencing of the viral genome from infected persons clinical specimens, along with information about the collection of the specimens (when and where), allow for phylogenetic reconstruction to track the circulation and transmission of the virus locally and globally. We use these data to understand viral movement, identify origins of introductions of different COVID-19 strains to the region, locate hot spots of local transmission and clusters of disease, and possibly determine the source of infection. We can also study mutations in the viral genome and their potential for causing increased transmission or virulence.

# [Methodology](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/)

Samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 (confirmed by RT-PCR) were extracted using the MagMax Viral Pathogen II kit from ThermoFisher. Extracted RNA was prepared for either whole meta-transcriptome sequencing or tiled amplicon sequencing. Whole meta-transcriptome sequencing was performed using either Tecan’s Ovation SoLo RNA Seq kit, or TakaraBio’s SMART-Seq Stranded kit, both according to manufacturer’s specifications. Tiled amplicon sequencing was performed using the ARTIC protocol (v1) by Josh Quick, and adapter addition was done using Seqwell’s plexWell kit, or Illumina’s DNA-prep kit, both according to manufacturer’s instructions for small amplicons. Sequencing was done on a NextSeq 550 with v2.5 chemistry, or a MiSeq with V3 chemistry.
