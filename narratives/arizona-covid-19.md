abstract: "Faculty at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), an affiliate of City of Hope, Northern Arizona University (NAU), University of Arizona (UArizona) and Arizona State University (ASU) launched the Arizona COVID Genomics Union (ACGU) to collaboratively track SARS-CoV-2, and examine how it evolves and how it spreads into, within and out of Arizona.
 
The ACGU uses state-of-the-art sequencers, custom computational analysis workflows, and supercomputers to determine the sequence of the virus’s RNA genome and reconstruct its evolutionary history with phylogenetics, to track its movements. TGen has so far sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from over 3,000 COVID-19 positive samples for the ACGU, and additional sequencing was performed at ASU and UArizona, from among the more than 200,000 positive cases in Arizona, making it one of the most robust such efforts in the nation. ACGU receives Arizona samples collected by state, county, tribal and private healthcare systems.
 
ACGU scientists take advantage of small changes or mutations in the virus’ genome, which naturally occur over time as the virus reproduces, to track the spread of the virus. By comparing mutations observed in Arizona to those present in strains circulating across the globe, they can determine when and from where the virus was introduced to Arizona, and comparing strains within Arizona they can map its spread within and among Arizona’s communities."

COVID-19 has gravely impacted Arizona, sweeping through urban areas, tribal communities, correctional facilities, assisted living facilities, and more over the past nine months. Arizona detected its first COVID-19 case on January 26th, but it was not until late March that state public health officials reported widespread community transmission. In June and July, Arizona’s peak during this pandemic, hospitalizations were at an all-time high, and rates among individuals aged 20-44 skyrocketed. Arizona’s case rate per 100,000 was almost double what was reported for the United States. As of September 15, 2020, Arizona has reported over 209,200 cases and 5,340 deaths. The Arizona Department of Health Services shares a [COVID-19 Data Dashboard](https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php) updated daily.

# [Arizona SARS-CoV-2 Genomes in a Global Context](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19?d=tree&f_division=Arizona&p=full)

This build includes a dataset of 812 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from COVID-19 positive patients from across Arizona. Testing was conducted at TGen North Clinical Laboratory, Arizona State Public Health Laboratory, and Sonora Quest Laboratory between March XX and June XX.
 
The Arizona genomes are shown here with a global dataset of approximately XX genomes shared in the GSAID database. A majority of the Arizona samples fall within the B1 lineage which is the dominating North American strain.
