abstract: "An Overview of Genomic Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Arizona

Arizona has reported an incredible number of COVID-19 cases, more than 250,000, since the beginning of this pandemic. But here in Arizona, we have sequenced and analyzed over 5,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, making this sequencing effort one of the most extensive in the nation."

# [Arizona SARS-CoV-2 Genomes in a Global Context](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/?c=location&p=full&d=tree)

By analyzing our phylogenetic trees closely, we specifically know that the virus was introduced at least twelve times during the early part of the pandemic, and that the first introductions resulting in community transmission in Arizona were in mid to late February, and mostly from domestic travel.

Rapid public health response efforts, including quarantining, testing, and contact tracing really helped to prevent further transmission of this initial case.

# [COVID-19 Level in Arizona is “Widespread”](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19/?c=location&d=map&f_division=Arizona&p=full&r=location)

On March 26, just 3 weeks after community transmission had been identified by public health in Arizona, the Arizona Department of Health Services declared COVID-19 in Arizona to be “Widespread”, indicating that ≥12 of the 15 counties reported cases.

The epidemiologic and genomic evidence correlate and suggest that an infected staff member introduced COVID-19 into this setting.

# [Rapid Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in an Arizona Tribal Community with Low Mortality](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19?c=mutation&d=tree&p=full)

Early on, evidence pointed to four independent clusters of COVID-19 occurring in the tribal community, however genomic analyses show that cases associated with these clusters stemmed from a single transmission chain.

Genomic analysis shows that this case seeded the outbreak comprising the majority of cases on this reservation, illustrated by the monophyletic clade defined by an amino acid change in the spike protein H245Y.

# [Contact Tracing Identified Likely Transmission Chain of SARS-CoV-2 from Index Case](https://nextstrain.org/community/tgennorth/arizona-covid-19)

The phylogenetic analysis of this cluster correlates well to the series of events uncovered in the epidemiological investigation, and suggests successful isolation efforts with no further spread - in and among these households. However, the larger outbreak in this tribal community stemmed from this single case, and this was uncovered only by genomic analysis.
